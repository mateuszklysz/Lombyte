# Contributing

Thanks for helping decompile *Ratchet & Clank*! The goal is to turn the
assembly-backed units under [`src/assembly/`](src/assembly/) into C that
compiles to the exact retail bytes. Writing C, recovering names, improving
types, and fixing docs all help.

The build is the safety net: it verifies the reconstructed executable against
retail byte-for-byte, so a contribution that would change the game fails the
build instead of slipping through.

## The contribution loop

### 1. Build the baseline once

Follow [Building](README.md#building) to install the required toolchain and
provide your own copy of the game, then run:

```sh
make elf
```

Some units need an optional patched EE-GCC profile
([docs/patched-toolchain.md](docs/patched-toolchain.md)); without it they fall
back to the retail oracle.

The run ends with `PASS: reconstructed boot ELF matches retail` and leaves a
workspace at `build/baseline` inside the checkout (override with
`BASELINE_ROOT`) holding the retail assembly and per-unit comparison targets
used below.

### 2. Pick a function

```sh
python3 scripts/list-functions.py --score
```

Lists the units whose C is still pending. `--score` measures each candidate's
C body against retail (about a minute for the full list) and lists the closest
first; without it the list is offline and sorted by size. `--limit` and
`--filter` narrow it.

Grab a unit name, for example `assembly/math/sign_extend_packed_value`. If you
want to claim it, open an issue or comment on an existing one with the unit
name.

### 3. Read the source and the retail assembly

Open the unit's source, e.g. `src/assembly/math/subtract_integer_with_clamp.c`.
While a unit is pending, it keeps the retail assembly as an *oracle* and the
readable C body as a fallback:

```c
#ifndef NON_MATCHING
INCLUDE_ASM("config/us/expected/asm/...", SubtractIntegerWithClamp);
#else
/* readable C body -- this is what you edit */
#endif /* NON_MATCHING */
```

The oracle is generated locally from your own game executable and keeps the
build byte-exact until the C replaces it. **Do not remove it while you work**:
only `check-unit` compiles the C body.

`check-unit` prints the retail disassembly path under `retail asm`. Read it
next to the C and the surrounding units.

### 4. Write the C

- Rewrite or extend the C body under `#else`. Seeded bodies are starting
  points; some are wrong or incomplete.
- Remove `__attribute__((section(".text.*")))` seed attributes: the retail
  unit object uses plain `.text`, and promoted units never use custom text
  sections.
- Keep the unit's canonical symbol name (the header's `SYMBOL:` field). A
  friendly name is welcome as an alias, e.g.
  `int MyName(int a0) __asm__("func_00123456");`.
- Declare variables at the start of blocks and use the project typedefs
  (`u32`, `s32`, `f32`, …) — this is GCC 2.9 era, not modern C.
- Keep it descriptive C: no inline assembly or copied disassembly in the body.

### 5. Check your work

```sh
python3 scripts/check-unit.py assembly/math/subtract_integer_with_clamp
```

This compiles just that unit's C body and compares it with the retail object,
printing the `.text` score, per-function scores, and the first differing
instructions. Iterate until it reports `Object matches (promotable).` — that
means the text matches and the strict pass found every non-`.text` section at
100% as well. `Text matches; data/rodata differ` means the text is byte-equal
but the data sections still differ, and the full gate will fail. If you pulled
changes since your last baseline build, re-run `make elf` first.

When `check-unit.py` reports text matches, the authoritative check is still the
full image:

```sh
make elf
```

### 6. Promote an exact unit

Once the unit matches, make the C the only compiled code:

1. Delete the `#ifndef NON_MATCHING` oracle block and the `#else` / `#endif`
   lines, leaving the C body.
2. Move the file out of the assembly tree:
   `git mv src/assembly/<path>.c src/<path>.c`.
3. In [`config/us/rnc1.us.yaml`](config/us/rnc1.us.yaml), change that unit's
   owner from `assembly/<path>` to `<path>`.
The file location plus the linker-config owner are the whole promotion: no
per-file metadata is written.

4. Run `make elf` again; it must end with `PASS`.
5. Regenerate the decomp.dev progress report with `make progress` and commit
   `progress/report.json` with the promotion; CI fails if it is stale.

### 7. Open a pull request

Commit with the project's message standard (see
[`docs/commit-messages.md`](docs/commit-messages.md)), for example
`decomp: promote SubtractIntegerWithClamp (24 B)`, and open a pull request
using the template. Include the unit name, its size, and the `PASS` line from
`make elf`. A maintainer will review and merge.

## Continuous integration

Every pull request runs the public `tools` job in
[`.github/workflows/checks.yml`](.github/workflows/checks.yml):

- `python3 scripts/test_public_tools.py -v` — the script regression suite;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py` — every public script must parse.

These checks need no game data and never upload build outputs. Run the same
checks locally with `make check`. The full `make elf` rebuild stays a local,
contributor-run gate (see above); CI does not run it for you.

The `progress` job in
[`.github/workflows/progress.yml`](.github/workflows/progress.yml) feeds
[decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev). It does not build the game and uses no
secrets: it checks that the committed `progress/report.json` matches the
repository (`scripts/gen_progress_report.py --check`), validates it with
objdiff, and uploads it as the `SCUS_971.99_report` artifact. The report is
made locally by `make progress` after `make elf`; it contains unit names,
symbols, addresses, sizes and match percentages only, never retail bytes.

## Not exact yet? That is still useful

You do not have to reach 100% to contribute. Keep the oracle in place (restore
it with `git checkout -- <file>` if you removed it while experimenting), leave
your improved C body under `#else`, make sure `make elf` still passes, and open
a work-in-progress pull request describing what you tried and where the first
mismatch is.

If you are stuck, open an issue with the unit name, the `check-unit` output,
and the mismatch you cannot classify. See
[`docs/decompilation-tips.md`](docs/decompilation-tips.md) for the full
acceptance discipline and the recovery ladder.

## House rules

- Keep changes focused; one unit per pull request is perfect for a first
  contribution.
- The check tools only read the checkout and write inside the baseline
  workspace (`build/baseline`, or `$BASELINE_ROOT` when you set one); they
  never touch other locations.
- Never commit game data, disc images, or compiler binaries. `dumps/`,
  `build/`, and `tools/` stay out of Git.
- Do not edit `tools/`; it is local toolchain setup.
- Do not refactor matching code for style: the generated bytes are the
  deliverable.
- Run `python3 scripts/test_public_tools.py` before changing anything under
  `scripts/`.
- Enable the commit-message hook once per checkout (optional but handy):

  ```sh
  ln -sf ../scripts/commit-msg.py .git/hooks/commit-msg
  ```
