/* strtod for IEEE-, VAX-, and IBM-arithmetic machines.
 *
 * This strtod returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal
 * string (or sets errno to ERANGE).  With IEEE arithmetic, ties are
 * broken by the IEEE round-even rule.  Otherwise ties are broken by
 * biased rounding (add half and chop).
 *
 * Inspired loosely by William D. Clinger's paper "How to Read Floating
 * Point Numbers Accurately" [Proc. ACM SIGPLAN '90, pp. 92-101].
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *	1. We only require IEEE, IBM, or VAX double-precision
 *		arithmetic (not IEEE double-extended).
 *	2. We get by with floating-point arithmetic in a case that
 *		Clinger missed -- when we're computing d * 10^n
 *		for a small integer d and the integer n is not too
 *		much larger than 22 (the maximum integer k for which
 *		we can represent 10^k exactly), we may be able to
 *		compute (d*10^k) * 10^(e-k) with just one roundoff.
 *	3. Rather than a bit-at-a-time adjustment of the binary
 *		result in the hard case, we use floating-point
 *		arithmetic to determine the adjustment to within
 *		one bit; only in really hard cases do we need to
 *		compute a second residual.
 *	4. Because of 3., we don't need a large table of powers of 10
 *		for ten-to-e (just some small tables, e.g. of 10^k
 *		for 0 <= k <= 22).
