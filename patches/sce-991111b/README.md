# Sony EE-GCC 2.9-ee-991111b (recovered source)

Second patch surface for the Sony/Cygnus EE line and the source of the
project's **game compiler**: the production stack below, applied to the pinned
archive, rebuilds the installed game-compiler `cc1` byte for byte
(`05ff323f6e75accbcec5129b233d7ec16a3045805ea3c2098572985bdcf0a19f`; joint
parity gate 55/58, full-ELF gate PASS).

- Contents: complete GCC + binutils tree, 8,139 entries, `gcc/version.c` says
  `2.9-ee-991111b`; target `mips64r5900-sf-elf`.
- Tool dirs used so far: `src/gcc`, `src/binutils`, `src/bfd`, `src/gas`.

Build notes: same 32-bit host recipe as
[`../ee-gcc-2.9-991111-01/`](../ee-gcc-2.9-991111-01/), **plus
`-fno-strict-aliasing` in the host CFLAGS** (`-O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fcommon
-std=gnu89 -D_GNU_SOURCE`). `real.c`'s float emulator type-puns through
`EMUSHORT` pointers; a modern host compiler with strict aliasing turns
`REAL_VALUE_NEGATE` into a no-op, so negative float/double constants are sent
to the `.sdata` pool instead of `li.s`/`li.d` (the retail SN cc1 emits
`li.s`/`li.d`).
Reference binary of
this vintage: `/root/rnc-toolchains/tier2-20260909/991111b-r4` (scores 79.87 on
`fun_0022f778`, so it is not the retail compiler for that unit).

## Production stack (game compiler)

Apply with `git apply` at the root of the extracted archive, in this order:

1. `0000-modern-host-fixes.patch` (host build only: `include/obstack.h`
   lvalue-cast fix and the generated `gcc/c-gperf.h`)
2. `0001`, `0015`, `0016`, `0019`, `0020`, `0021`, `0022`, `0025`, `0026`,
   `0027`, `0028`, `0029`, `0030`, `0031`, `0032`, `0033`, `0034`, `0037`
3. `0036`, `0044`, `0045`, `0046`, `0047`, `0048`, `0049`

Configure for `--target=mips64r5900-sf-elf --host=i686-linux-gnu
--build=i686-linux-gnu --disable-nls --enable-languages=c --without-headers`
and build `cc1` with `make LANGUAGES=c 'CC=gcc -m32' 'CFLAGS=-O2
-fno-strict-aliasing -fcommon -std=gnu89 -D_GNU_SOURCE' cc1`; the result is
`cc1` `05ff323f6e75accb…` (verified 2026-09-23 from a fresh extraction;
through `0048` it is `4dfa3cf0f0fa8d31…`).
`0035` and `0038` are published but not part of the production stack.

Patches marked *production dependency* are in that stack but turned no
fixture exact on their own; they are published so the production compiler is
reproducible from this directory. Every other entry names its exact fixture.

## Published patches

- `0049-sibcall-pass-needs-placeholder.patch` SHA-256: `6b9dae8921c7cdcc9cae3879f92990c969fd098aed7594afa7d98db8c33e714a`
  - cc1 (production stack): `05ff323f6e75accbcec5129b233d7ec16a3045805ea3c2098572985bdcf0a19f`
  - role: default. The Cygnus 2.9 sibcall pass (absent from gcc-2.95.2 and
    from the SN compiler) ran `jump_optimize_minimal` and a CFG rebuild on
    every function before the RTL dump, even with sibling calls off (0022).
    That deleted the jump to the return label after the last `return`, so
    the first jump pass if-converted `return 1; ... return 0;` tails
    (`v0 = 0` hoisted above the first branch, `sltu` into `v0`), which moved
    parameters out of `v0`/`v1`. The pass now returns early when no
    `CALL_PLACEHOLDER` exists; `-mastra-cygnus-cfg` restores the old
    behavior per unit
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_001eb740` -> 100.0 (76.36 before; SN emits the
    same code for the same source)
  - ten promoted sources matched against the old behavior take
    `-mastra-cygnus-cfg` (`configure.py`); full-ELF gate PASS; joint gate
    55/58; without per-unit flags the promoted sweep gains `fun_001fdd10`,
    `fun_00206f50`, `fun_002073b8`, `fun_0020c9e0` (SN-exact sources)
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23

  - role: production dependency. Path B slice 1: the whole gcc-2.95.2
    `reload1.c`, the gcc-2.95.2 `local-alloc.c` equivalence fixes (the hard
    frame pointer is not invariant; `REG_EQUIV` is tested on the
    initialising insn) and the `regclass.c` `'p'` constraint
  - measured: promoted sources 0 lost, pending units +4/-0 (all below 80 %),
    joint gate 55/58, full-ELF gate PASS
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23 (production dependency)

- `0045-encode-section-info-sda-nosda.patch` SHA-256: `de44f2608b06689b9e9885d6fa09dcd9f951599ef78d36eee74bce00e7cf7d0f`
  - role: production dependency. `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO`: `DECL_NOSDA` forces
    an absolute reference, `DECL_SDA` a gp-relative one (after SN's
    section/size heuristics); reference half of the SN `sda`/`nosda` port
  - inert without annotations: joint gate 55/58 unchanged, full-ELF PASS
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23 (production dependency)

- `0044-sda-nosda-attributes.patch` SHA-256: `b14f446a4f03387aae3a78a21a245e0d10c5274e592fb95673674d3636c5bd46`
  - role: production dependency. SN's `sda`/`nosda` variable attributes
    (`tree.h` decl bits, `c-common.c` handler with SN's mutual exclusion and
    `VAR_DECL`-only rule, `mips_select_section` placement); definition half of
    the port (`.data` <-> `.sdata` proven on an A/B object)
  - inert without annotations: joint gate 55/58 unchanged, full-ELF PASS
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23 (production dependency)

- `0000-modern-host-fixes.patch` SHA-256: `90cec417b339e7afd8407e50c49b28a6ad438aa91e5a994f40a25bba0d1d73ad`
  - role: production dependency (host build only, no codegen change):
    `include/obstack.h` lvalue-cast fix for modern host compilers and the
    `gcc/c-gperf.h` that `gperf` generates from `c-parse.gperf`
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23 (production dependency)

- `0048-pathb-cse-2952.patch` SHA-256: `8dda70c9c214edd67b1b34febe7b49bb0d3bea5e3bb391c1958e39da46e12e34`
  - cc1 (production stack): `4dfa3cf0f0fa8d31a5efa074d4fede0d31a75c8a3e3d1d5e7f4862968b33aab9`
  - role: default. Path B slice 2: the whole gcc-2.95.2 `cse.c` on the 2.9
    tree, with shims for what the 2.9 tree lacks (`splay_tree_compare_ints`,
    `fnotice`, `do_float_handler`, `shallow_copy_rtx` taken from 2.95.2)
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_00226a70` -> 100.0 (84.26 without it)
  - promoted sources +1 / 0 lost; joint gate 55/58; full-ELF gate PASS with
    `fun_00226a70` promoted
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-23

- `0046-r5900-pad-unfilled-loops.patch` SHA-256: `a29addcdc9e12bba51192f48e38c628d4ad1d8d4695d0462f31aede6189edf31`
  - cc1 (committed P1..P37 baseline + 0036 + 0044/0045 (installed, unpublished)
    + 0046): `eb7a3497c39e0f73fc4f01bcda7de426c071c8f2f9d4702ffecefb5a6e1c8743`
  - role: default: extend the P19 post-dbr R5900 short-loop padding to loops
    closed by a branch whose delay slot reorg left empty. Such branches (and
    unfilled calls) are emitted in reorder mode and GAS appends the delay NOP,
    so each occupies two words; retail pads the loop to 7 words
    (`jal; nop x4; bnez; nop`). P19 only measured loops closed by a filled
    `SEQUENCE`, so these loops were never padded
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_0012eb20` -> 100.0 (with `-mastra-r5900-extern-buffer`
    and a local `s32 args[4]` argument buffer)
  - wide sweep 282 -> 284 exact (+`runtime/state/read_state_field`,
    +`textbin/fun_0012f208`; 0 regressions across all 557); joint gate 55/58
    unchanged; full-ELF gate PASS with `fun_0012eb20` promoted
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-22

- `0038-unannul-redundant.patch` SHA-256: `563a644f5a0102ce4150ffb938db6a287d17eb5d47f638a0ccb49091dc1fe767`
  - cc1 (P26..P34 + 0036 + 0037 + 0038 stack): `6b66b17be24bff8c47dafad65432ec1575d32c804cbbb54cfe1b4a1f70bea805`
  - role: default: clear a spuriously-annulled branch (`beqzl` where retail
    keeps plain `beqz`) in the one narrow shape where `reorg.c`'s generic
    delay-slot filler picks the annulled form only because its liveness walk
    (`mark_target_live_regs`/`next_insn_no_annul`) treats the very next
    already-delay-filled branch as opaque and never sees that branch's own
    delay-slot write - a genuine blind spot confirmed present in genuine
    upstream FSF gcc-2.95.2 too, not something this project's own patches
    introduced (reproduced on the bare P1 baseline)
  - root cause found by runtime instrumentation (fprintf traces at every real
    `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P` assignment site in a rebuilt `cc1`), not static
    source reading - three earlier static theories about this exact mechanism
    were each disproven first; see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` in the tools repo
    for the full trace
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_002071c0` -> 100.0. The compiler patch alone only
    narrows this unit's residual (91.111 -> 92.778%, zero movement on every
    other unit in the corpus); reaching exact also required an independent,
    unrelated paired source-shape fix on the same file (an early-return guard
    inverted to the project's established positive-guard pattern)
  - wide sweep 276 -> 277 exact (+1/0 regressions across all 557); joint gate
    55/58 unchanged
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-20

- `0037-game-no-strict-aliasing.patch` SHA-256: `5c25409ae438dd09e8720c93a0c81898ac3001c30d3f9fe1c59b1ebbbeeed261`
  - cc1 (P26..P34 + 0036 + 0037 stack): `82b332bbd4512c0e7d85c75d8af7d9fef398578b1e68d4b700d2c244aeae4866`
  - role: game-only default: disable strict-aliasing-based optimization at
    `-O2` (matches SN/retail codegen for pointer-aliased loads/stores); scoped
    to the game compiler, not the SDK route
  - fixtures: `assembly/textbin/fun_001f6250`, `textbin/fun_001fe898`,
    `textbin/attach_manipulator`, `textbin/audio_dec_begin_put`,
    `textbin/fun_00233980`, `textbin/fun_0012ee08` -> 100.0
  - game-only route-aware battery: 175/213 -> 178/213 exact (+3/0); P37
    controls 55/58 (not a clean same-stack comparator against the historical
    52/58 receipt)
  - Path-A: all four compiled objects link byte-equal to their retail slices;
    full ELF gate remains blocked by the known missing-expected-object units
    `fun_00221968`/`fun_002267b8` (documented exception, not a compiler gap)
  - published via ASTRA 2026-09-20

- `0036-retire-frame-save-pref.patch` SHA-256: `0c0970ecc7e2ca5d18bc3c1e1609a17d3600b35511a400a11e54ea6d0dee7711`
  - cc1 (P26..P34 + 0036 stack): `5c1bf8e5bcf0c40d03149bc1b50fd470ff260054f192de4844e77e77637940ea`
  - role: retire the P26/P33 frame-store preference. With P29's call-clobber
    graph the preference is no longer needed: all six P26 fixtures stay exact
    without it, and removing it fixes the last blocked `$ra`-placement residual
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_00201128` -> 100.0 (the `$ra` save now follows the
    last argument captures, matching retail)
  - evidence: sched2 ready lists vs the SN oracle are identical at all 38
    cycles only after the removal (with P26/P33, t=6/t=7 differ); the deciding
    pairs (ra save 100 vs capture moves 10/12) are never directly compared by
    qsort, so pairwise predicates could not act
  - parity: wide 272 -> 273 (+1 / zero regressions across all 557); joint gate
    54/58 unchanged; installed production cc1 `5c1bf8e5bcf0c40d`
  - note: 0026/0033 remain in the stack history and are neutralized by 0036;
    `0035-extern-buffer-default` is not part of the production stack (P34 stays
    opt-in)

- `0035-extern-buffer-default.patch` SHA-256: `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
  - cc1 (P26..P35 stack): `f920538211f2b03699b15e6f8c97e4cc302e1b556f39bd0d8488e0cf5fa2d476`
  - role: enable the P34 R5900/GAS extern buffering by default
  - fixtures: `textbin/fun_0021f8e8`, `textbin/snd_unk_function_0012eb00` -> 100.0
  - in-scope textbin: +2 / 0 (161/213 exact); the 8 all-557 sweep regressions
    are units owned by other routes (patched profile, padless assembler,
    native EE-GCC 2.9) and are unaffected in the real build
  - joint gate 54/58 unchanged


- `0034-r5900-extern-buffer-optin.patch` SHA-256: `085ac4b30bf79e56c9f51c58013ac22cd77b62456c8f6669e909bca5435088bc`

  - role: opt-in R5900/GAS extern buffering (`-mastra-r5900-extern-buffer`):
    the body is buffered and the `.extern name,size` declarations of
    GP-eligible bare integer references are emitted in front of it, so GAS can
    pick the retail gp-relative form; `TARGET_FILE_SWITCHING` is untouched
  - default-neutral: flag off = 272 exact, zero diffs
  - flag on: +4/-8 on the corpus; the 2 in-scope conversions are
    `textbin/fun_0021f8e8`, `textbin/snd_unk_function_0012eb00`; all 8
    regressions are units owned by other routes (patched profile, padless
    assembler, non-textbin)


- `0033-ra-not-vs-nonframe.patch` SHA-256: `c399a2055c8a4b743b5b39a826bc72c29a1f0b7d552e98f627a34777042a52e1`

  - role: the P26 frame-save preference no longer applies to the `$ra` save
    against non-frame instructions (its priority/depend-count order is kept,
    matching retail), while `$ra` vs other saves is unchanged
  - fixtures: `textbin/fun_002144d8`, `textbin/fun_00238520` -> 100.0

  - role: place every pad NOP before the instruction preceding the branch so
    the delay-slot filler sees that instruction first (retail geometry: two
    pads before the branch, loop increment in the slot)
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_002172c0` -> 100.0
  - parity: wide 268 -> 270 (+2 / zero regressions); joint gate 54/58 unchanged

  - role: default branch-likely fallback for branches whose tested register was
    produced by an arithmetic comparison (`slt` etc.); uses the branch's own
    zero test, safe because not-taken of `ne dest,0` implies dest is zero
  - fixture: `textbin/fun_00220790` -> 100.0
  - parity: wide 268 -> 269 (+1 / zero regressions); joint gate 54/58 unchanged

  - role: R5900 short-loop padding placement; a single pad NOP goes before the
    instruction preceding the branch so the delay-slot filler can place a
    useful instruction (movn) in the slot, with the NOP as fallback before the
    branch (retail layout)
  - fixtures: `textbin/fun_00215290`, `textbin/fun_00215300`,
    `textbin/fun_00215348` -> 100.0
  - in-scope textbin parity: +3 / 0 (155/213 exact); all-557 sweep 267 (the

  - role: port the GCC 2.95.2 call-clobber dependency analysis (pending
    clobbers instead of `reg_pending_sets`; keep `reg_last_uses`)
  - effect: the a0/a1 argument-setup order, the `sq ra`/`sq s0` save order and
    several scheduler tie-break classes now match SN by default
  - wide promoted parity: 237 -> 266 exact (+29 / zero regressions);

    delay-slot write of the tested register)
  - fixtures: `textbin/fun_0023d2d8`, `textbin/vo_buf_get_data` -> 100.0

    references to a symbol whose size is not yet known become `lui %hi` +
