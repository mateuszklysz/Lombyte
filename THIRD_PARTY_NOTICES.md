# Third-party notices

Most of this repository is covered by the MIT license. Parts of `src/`
reconstruct runtime code that was statically linked into the retail
executable; those files remain under their original licenses and are not
covered by MIT.

The set of such files changes as the decompilation progresses, so it is not
enumerated here. Affected files carry the upstream attribution in their source
comments; this page groups them by upstream project and points to the full
license texts in `licenses/`.

## GCC runtime — libgcc2 and soft-float (fp-bit)

GPL-2.0-or-later with the standard GCC runtime exception: linking this library
with other files does not by itself place the resulting executable under the
GPL. Full text: [`licenses/GPL-2.0.txt`](licenses/GPL-2.0.txt).

## newlib

BSD-style Regents of the University of California notice. The newlib allocator
derives from dlmalloc 2.6.5 by Doug Lea, released to the public domain.
Collection license: [`licenses/COPYING.NEWLIB.txt`](licenses/COPYING.NEWLIB.txt).
