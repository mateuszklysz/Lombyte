# Patched EE-GCC profile (optional)

Some units in `src/` were matched with a patched build of EE-GCC
2.9-ee-991111-01. It is optional: `make elf` reproduces the retail executable
without it, rebuilding those units from the retail oracle instead of their C.
Install the profile to compile and verify their C.

The patch lives in
[`patches/ee-gcc-2.9-991111-01/`](../patches/ee-gcc-2.9-991111-01/): 124
changed lines over 8 files, adding opt-in `-mastra-*` flags (inert by default),
R5900 `sq`/`lq` saves, classic `mult`/`mflo` code generation, and the
in-place `cvt.w.s` conversion (`-mastra-inplace-cvt`), against the
public snapshot
[`SSXModding/ps2-ee-toolchain`](https://github.com/SSXModding/ps2-ee-toolchain)
at `b595ded`.

## Build

Needs Linux or WSL with 32-bit host support (`gcc -m32`, e.g.
`gcc-multilib`), plus git and make. The script clones the pinned snapshot,
applies the patch, and builds `cc1`/`cpp`/`xgcc`. It fetches and builds bison
1.28 itself when needed (the 991111 grammar needs it).

```sh
python3 scripts/build-patched-toolchain.py
export HIMURO_PATCHED_ROOT="$PWD/tools/ee-gcc2.9-991111-01-patched"
make elf
```

Options: `--source-dir DIR` (reuse a checkout, offline), `--bison PATH`,
`--check` (verify the patch only), `--verify-hashes`.

The reference hashes are in the patch README and `provenance.json`. GCC embeds
build paths, so rebuilds elsewhere differ; the script smoke-tests the compiler,
and `make elf` verifies the result byte-for-byte.

## Without the profile

`configure.py` rebuilds the affected units from the retail oracle, writes
`config/us/oracle-fallback-units.json`, and provides C-level aliases for the
link via `config/us/oracle-aliases.txt`. The image is still byte-exact.
`scripts/check-unit.py` refuses to score those units, so oracle bytes are never
reported as a C match.
