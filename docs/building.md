# Building

The verified environment is **Linux/WSL**. The SN compiler is a Windows
executable and has to be runnable, so a plain Linux setup is not enough by
itself. Compiler versions matter for matching: preserve the directory layouts and
the executable permissions, and expect the toolchain binaries to be installed by
you — nothing here is downloaded.

Everything below is run from the checkout root, and `RNC_GAME_ROOT` in the
sibling tooling repository points at this checkout.

## 1. Build tools

| Tool                                                | Required location                                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EE-GCC `2.9-ee-991111-01`                           | `tools/compilers/ee-gcc2.9-991111-01/`                                            |
| SN EE-GCC `2.95.2`                                  | `tools/compilers/ee-gcc-2.95.2/` (with `bin/ee-gcc.exe` and its supporting tools) |
| R5900 binutils                                      | the `mips-ps2-decompals-*` executables; set `BINUTILS_ROOT` to their directory    |
| [objdiff CLI](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) | `tools/objdiff/objdiff-cli`                                                       |
| Ninja, Python dependencies                          | installed into `.venv` below                                                      |

A few units were matched with an optional patched EE-GCC profile. `make elf` does
not need it — those units fall back to the retail oracle — but install it to work
on their C:

```sh
python3 scripts/build-patched-toolchain.py
export EE_GCC_PATCHED_ROOT="$PWD/tools/ee-gcc2.9-991111-01-patched"
```

See [patched-toolchain.md](patched-toolchain.md).

## 2. Python environment

```sh
cd ~/Lombyte
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Point this at your installed R5900 binutils.
export BINUTILS_ROOT="$HOME/tools/binutils-mips-ps2-decompals"
```

Use the versions pinned in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt); `spimdisasm`
is pinned to match the expected disassembly.

## 3. Original game files

Extract `SCUS_971.99` from the root of your USA disc image and place it at
`config/us/SCUS_971.99`, then verify it against the hash in the front page:

```sh
sha256sum config/us/SCUS_971.99
```

For an ISO rebuild, also place your original disc image at `dumps/game.iso`
(create `dumps/` if needed). Both inputs are ignored by Git.

## 4. Build the executable

```sh
make elf
```

The build stages the sources, splits the reference executable, materialises the
assembly-backed units' oracles, compiles and links, generates an objdiff report,
and verifies the reconstructed executable against retail.

The staging directory defaults to `build/baseline` inside the checkout and is
**recreated on every run**. If the checkout lives on a Windows-mounted drive
(`/mnt/c/...`), point `BASELINE_ROOT` at a native Linux directory such as
`$HOME/rnc-baseline` so the frozen 32-bit compiler works on a local filesystem.

| Output                   | Default location                             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Reconstructed boot ELF   | `build/baseline/config/us/build/SCUS_971.99` |
| Object comparison report | `build/baseline/config/us/report.json`       |

A successful run ends with:

```text
PASS: reconstructed boot ELF matches retail
baseline build OK
```

## 5. The gate

```sh
./verify-baseline.sh
```

This is the acceptance check, not a convenience wrapper: it rebuilds the
baseline and compares the SHA-256 of the **built** ELF with the one in the front
page. On failure it prints `baseline build failed with status N; no PASS receipt
produced` and exits non-zero, so a green run is evidence and a red one is not
quietly ignored. Run it before proposing a promotion and before committing.

## 6. Disc image

```sh
make iso
```

Rebuilds the executable, then patches it into a copy of the first `dumps/*.iso`
found — keep exactly one input ISO there so the selection is unambiguous. The
original is preserved, and with a byte-identical boot ELF the rebuilt image
matches your own. The output is
`build/Ratchet & Clank (USA) - rebuilt.iso`; `make clean-iso` removes it.

To patch an already-built ELF with explicit paths:

```sh
python3 rebuild-iso.py \
  --iso dumps/game.iso \
  --elf "$BASELINE_ROOT/config/us/build/SCUS_971.99" \
  --out build/rebuilt.iso
```

make elf
```

## Generated, not stored

`config/us/build.ninja`, `config/us/expected/asm/` and `build/` are produced
during a build from your own retail executable and are ignored by Git. The
repository stores no oracle and no extracted game data, which is why a build
cannot start before step 3.

The layout of both repositories is mapped in `docs/project-map.md` in the
sibling tooling checkout, together with the compiler inventory and which route
owns which unit.
